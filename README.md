# screenscene
This module pans and scales the scene to to centralize the image, designed for playing foundryvtt games on a tabletop

# To use:

This currently assumes you have designed your map to fit your available screen size. 

For best effect, the image size should follow the formula:

# of pixels in x = TV width (inches) * image DPI (and in Foundry the "grid size" should be set to the same number as the image DPI)
# of pixels in y = TV height (inches) * image DPI
